// Prototype - parent of other

// define another object - shape and add all common methods for object
// link circle with shape object

// shape - protoype - parent of other object
let x = {};

// prototype is master parent

/*  ------------- This shows objectBase -----------
    x -> (links to parent) objectBase - Prototype
*/


// every object directly or inderectly is from objectBase (prototype)

// when accessing method a property or method on object javascript mocks up 
// chain to find parent member

// prototype is just a regular object
// only root object doesnt have prototype
